# TinDog-Project
TinDog is a web application designed to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. By contributing to this project, I have gained valuable experience in web development and honed my skills in using Bootstrap. I am excited to continue working on TinDog and explore future opportunities to enhance my knowledge and create innovative web apps.
